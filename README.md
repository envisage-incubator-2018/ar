# TODO

Connect controllers to phone
- create a movement system using this
- have a nice way to select controller on phone 
	- maybe a list of game controllers and you can select one
	- this should be before entering vr mode

Complete soccer room
- teams
- scoreboard that players can look at
- teams selection method? 
	- perhaps using bens raycasting system through a menu
	- or a position based method where you walk onto different platform that teleport you in the game

Custom models for players and server-side objects
- how does the server send these models since they each need to be loaded in such a custom way?
- maybe a standard for player models could be set
	- something like: each object/player model requires a .mtl file and .obj file
	- what about cubes/spheres?

Actual UI menus for everything haha
- leaving/joining rooms
- a good way for entering/leaving vr mode (not the default boilerplate method)
